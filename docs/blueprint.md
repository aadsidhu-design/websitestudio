# **App Name**: AnimAI Studio

## Core Features:

- Project Creation & Management: Users create and manage projects to store all animation assets and settings in a dedicated 'folder'.
- AI-Powered Storyboard Generation: Generate a storyboard for the animation, using AI to outline the scenes and frames, with options to switch between NanoBanana and other models. Incorporates Midjourney-like features for generating multiple storyboard options.
- Collaborative Editing & Annotation: Enable users to collaboratively edit and comment directly on storyboard frames and animation sequences using selection and drawing tools within the canvas. The AI uses the comments as a tool.
- AI Frame Generation & Animation: Automatically generate individual frames and animate sequences based on the storyboard, leveraging AI to ensure consistent character and background rendering.
- Frame Editing & Adjustment: Provide AI-powered tools for editing specific frames, adjusting details, and correcting inconsistencies to maintain visual quality.
- Scene Length Generation: AI determines appropriate scene lengths (10 sec - 15 min) based on user prompts and context, generating continuous scenes.
- Export & Import: Users can export frames and clips to external editing software and import them back to integrate them with the existing animation.
- Version Control and Reverting: Implement checkpoints before significant actions, such as submitting messages, so the user can revert to an earlier version of the project if needed.

## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Vivid Blue (#4285F4) evoking creativity and innovation.
- Background color: Dark theme, similar to Lovable, with light blue-gray (#E8EAED) elements to focus user's attention on canvas and content.
- Accent color: Vibrant Orange (#F4B400) highlighting interactivity and AI.
- Body and headline font: 'Inter', sans-serif, to emphasize its objective, modern look.
- Streamlined workflow, similar to lovable.dev, starting with a prompt input on the landing page leading to a canvas-chat layout for interactive editing and review.
- Canvas on the right and chat on the left with an adjustable horizontal bar; timeline, frame navigation, export/import options at the top. Incorporate a Lovable-style interface for visual clarity.
- Clean, modern icons for tools (draw, select, comment) inspired by 21st.dev's design.
- Subtle UI animations and transitions to provide feedback and guide the user through the animation creation process smoothly.
